  - rscadd: "Organ Smartfridges! Store your organs safely. Upgrading the matter bin will give it the ability to heal organs held within- though this does not repair organs that are currently failing, however."
  - rscadd: "Lobectomy! Not lobotomy, but cuts out a damaged lung lobe to make its performance passable. Restores a lung to working order if it was too damaged to work before, but can only be done once. The lobectomy step has a 95% chance of success, so use some form of sterilizer to ensure you don't accidentally get blood inside your patient's lungs!"
  - rscadd: "Coronary Bypass! Restores a heart to working order if it was too damaged to work before, but can only be done once. Both incising the heart and grafting the bypass have a 90% chance to succeed, and failing them will cause heart damage and massive amounts of bleeding- so be sure to work with ideal conditions, proper tools, and sterilizer!"
